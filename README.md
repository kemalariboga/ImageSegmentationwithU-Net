# ImageSegmentationwithU-Net
Building U-Net and implementing it with CARLA self-driving car simulator dataset

In this model, the know-how was obtained from [Deep Learning Specialization Course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), and the dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ongchinkiat/LyftPerceptionChallenge/releases/download/v0.1/carla-capture-20180513A.zip)
